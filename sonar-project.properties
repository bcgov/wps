# reasons for ignoring things for code coverage:
# api/scripts/** - this code does not run as part of the application.
# api/alembic/** - database migrations shouldn't have unit tests.
# api/app/tests/** - test code doesn't have tests.
# api/app/db/crud.py - unit tests don't talk to a database.
# api/app/db/database.py - this should mostly be stubbed out, and not ever be covered by unit tests.
# web - we don't need coverage reports on stories or tests
# web/src/features/cHaines/** - the UI is alpha, if we're going to keep it, it needs a massive re-factor.
