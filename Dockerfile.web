# SUPER IMPORTANT: NODE_OPTIONS="--v8-pool-size=1"
# A pod running in our openshift cluster, will report a ridiculous amount of cpu's available, as
# it's reporting on the underlying hardware. Node, in it's wisdom, will try to scale to using a
# huge amount of cpu's, which in turn results in massive memory usage. It's very important to limit
# the cpu pool size to something realistic.
