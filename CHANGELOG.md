## 2022-04-26 HFI Calc - Migrate Material UI from v4 to v5, Part1 [#1896](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/wildfire-predictive-services-5e321393e038fba5bbe203b8/issues/bcgov/wps/1896)

### Refactor

- **all products** Added the new libraries, updated component imports and ran the codemod while keeping the existing CSS in JSS libraries in place. Eventually (part 2) we will remove the CSS in JS build library in favor of the direction MaterialUI is going with the emotion CSS engine.

## 2022-04-11 HFI Calc : Prep Period [#1634](https://github.com/bcgov/wps/issues/1634)

### Features

- **hfi calculator:** Load the most recently saved prep record that overlaps with the current date. (Previous behaviour was to load the most recently modified prep record.)
- **hfi calculator:** Changing the prep period date does not result in a write to the database. Users can change thus change dates without affecting other users. (Previous behaviour was to create/update a prep record when changing the date.)
- **hfi calculator:** When a fire starts are changed or weather stations are toggled, a prep period record is created in the database.
- **hfi calculator:** Changing the prep period end date results in losing fire starts & weather station toggles. (Previous behaviour would retain fire starts & weather station toggles if the start date was unchanged.)
- **hfi calculator:** Changed warning message from "Any changes made to dates, fire starts or selected stations ..." to "Any changes made to fire starts or selected stations..."
