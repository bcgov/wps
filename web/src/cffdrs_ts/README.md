# cffdrs
This is a TypeScript translation of the R code available from [cran](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cffdrs/index.html) - this does not include all the functionality available in that package yet.

This project provides a group of new functions to calculate the outputs of the two main components of the [Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS) Van Wagner and Pickett (1985)](https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/publications?id=19973) at various time scales: the [Fire Weather Index (FWI) System Wan Wagner (1985)](https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/publications?id=19927) and the [Fire Behaviour Prediction (FBP) System Forestry Canada Fire Danger Group (1992)](http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/pubwarehouse/pdfs/10068.pdf). Some functions have two versions, table and raster based.
