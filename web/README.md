# Wildfire Predictive Services Web Application

## Description

Wildfire Predictive Services to support decision making in prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 10.x and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

Note: We are using Node 10 as a base image on our pipeline.

### Installing

In the project directory, run:

#### `yarn`

Installs all dependencies in the node_modules folder.

### Executing program

In the project directory, create `.env` file at root using `.env.example` as a sample, then you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

##### Running the application in docker:

1. Create `.env` file at root using `.env.example` as a sample
2. Run `docker-compose build` and then `docker-compose up`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Config

In `openshift/templates/global.config.yaml` there is a template for a global ConfigMap. This template can be applied to the Openshift project from the command line. For example, to apply the global.config template and pass a value for the REACT_APP_KEYCLOAK_REALM parameter, run

`oc -n <openshift-project-name> process -f openshift/templates/global.config.yaml -p REACT_APP_KEYCLOAK_REALM=<realm-name> | oc create -f -`
