I've tried to keep things related to the fire zone, fire centre and hfi polygons separate from the "app" module.

It makes sense to me, that it's NOT "app" code.

It does make the folder "api" redundant!


# step 1 - classify

```bash
python -m advisory.classify_hfi /home/sybrand/Workspace/wps/api/advisory/hfi20220720.tif out.tif
```

Validate output, manuall:
qgis : TODO: elaborate

# step 2 - polygonize

```bash

```
