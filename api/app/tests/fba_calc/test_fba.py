"""
Unit tests for fire behavour calculator.

NOTE: Regarding the json files used in these tests:
The JSON request files were manually generated referencing requests generated by the user interface by
inspecting the network tab.
The JSON response files were generated by copying the "actual" output of the tests.
Running the test with this syntax `pytest app/tests/fba/test_fba.py -s` will result in actual vs. expected
JSON to be printed out to screen. If the tests are failing, a developer can inspect the JSON and establish
if the change in output is due to a bug, or due to a valid change.
