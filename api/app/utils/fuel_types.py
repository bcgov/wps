# TODO: Move these constants (as columns) into fuel_types table in our database once all CFL
# values have been confirmed.
#
# PC, PDF, CC, CDH, CBH from the Red Book.
# CC: Assume values of None for non grass types, and 0 for O1A and O1B.
# CFL is based on Table 8, page 35, of "Development and Structure of the Canadian Forest Fire Behaviour
# Prediction System" from Forestry Canada Fire Danger Group, Information Report ST-X-3, 1992.
# For D1, D2, O1A, O1B, S1, S2 and S3 - a value of 1.0 is used.
# NOTE: For any given fuel types, there are a large number of possible permutations, e.g.
#   M3 can have some range 0 to 100% of dead fir in it. These values merely represent the most common
#   default set of configurations we're likely to encounter.
