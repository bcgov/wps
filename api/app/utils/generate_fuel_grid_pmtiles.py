"""
Simple local script for generating PMTiles files for the fuel grid.
This script can be used to generate both low resolution (2km) and high resolution (500m) fuel grid PMTiles.

The high res fuel grid (Currently 500m) typically will work for zoom levels 7-12.
The low res fuel grid (Currently 2km) is needed for zoom levels 4-6.

The low res PMTiles can be generated by simply running this script without any arguments and setting the
low_res_geotiff and low_res_pmtiles_output variables to the desired input and output paths.

The high res PMTiles can be generated by running this script with the "highres" argument and setting all
variables appropriately.
