### Offline Basemap

- The pmtiles file for the offline basemap was extracted using the [pmtiles cli extract command](https://docs.protomaps.com/pmtiles/cli#extract) using a `maxzoom` of 6 to keep the file small for offline caching.

```
pmtiles extract https://build.protomaps.com/20250326.pmtiles bc_basemap_20250326.pmtiles --maxzoom=6 --bbox=-139.06,60,-114.03,48.3
```

- The pmtiles data was sourced from the Protomaps Basemap daily build which is derived from OpenStreetMap. See <https://docs.protomaps.com/basemaps/downloads>.
- The MapBox/MapLibre style for the pmtiles basemap was generated using the [protomaps/basemaps styles package](https://github.com/protomaps/basemaps/tree/main/styles).
- The MapBox/MapLibre style is applied to the OpenLayers VectorTile layer using [ol-mapbox-style](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-mapbox-style)'s `applyStyle` function.
