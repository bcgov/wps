Automatically update TLS Certificates on OpenShift Routes

## Assumptions

- Using <https://letsencrypt.org/> for issuing certificates
- Using <https://certbot.eff.org/> for managing (create/renew) certificates
- Run inside OpenShift

## Solution

- Create a OpenShift `CronJob` which will run on a regular schedule for renewing TLS certificate if required.
  - The `CronJob` will manage a set of required `Service` and `Route`s objects.
  - The `CronJob` manages certificates of all routes with a label `certbot-managed=true`
  - One certificate will be issued/renewed for all the managed hosts/domains.
- If a cert is created/renewed, apply the new certificate to the related routes

## Installation

1. Point to the appropriate namespace (usually tools)

    ``` sh
    export NAMESPACE=<YOURNAMESPACE>

    oc project $NAMESPACE
    ```

1. Install `certbot.bc.yaml` to create the required build objects.
    _Note: If the build fails, make sure your namespace contains an NSP allowing '@app:k8s:serviceaccountname=builder' (OCP builders) to access 'ext:network=any' (egress internet)_

    This template accepts the following parameters (add with -p to the `oc process` command):

    | Parameter | Default Value | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `BASE_IMAGE` | `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8:8.3-227` | Base Image to build from |
    | `GIT_REF` | `master` | Git Pull Request or Branch Reference (i.e. 'pull/CHANGE_ID/head') |
    | `GIT_URL` | `https://github.com/BCDevOps/certbot.git` | Git Repository URL |

    ``` sh
    oc process -n $NAMESPACE -f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BCDevOps/certbot/master/openshift/certbot.bc.yaml" | oc apply -n $NAMESPACE -f -
    ```

1. Install `certbot.dc.yaml` to create the CronJob and supporting objects (NSP, ServiceAccount, RoleBinding, PVC, etc).
    This template accepts the following parameters (add with -p to the `oc process` command):

    | Parameter | Default Value | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `CERTBOT_CRON_SCHEDULE` | `0 */12 * * *` | Cronjob Schedule |
    | `CERTBOT_STAGING` | `false` | Self-signed cert renewals |
    | `CERTBOT_SUSPEND_CRON` | `false` | Suspend cronjob |
    | `CERTBOT_SERVER` | `https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory` | ACME Certbot endpoint |
    | `DRYRUN` | `false` | Run without executing |
    | `DEBUG` | `false` | Debug mode |
    | `DELETE_ACME_ROUTES` | `true` | Self cleanup temporary ACME routes when done |
    | `EMAIL` | | Email where CSR requests are sent to |
    | `NAMESPACE` | | Openshift Namespace |
    | `IMAGE_REGISTRY` | `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000` | Openshift Image Registry |
    | `SOURCE_IMAGE_NAME` | `certbot` | Image Name |
    | `TAG_NAME` | `latest` | Image Tag |

    - For non-prod environments, you may set `CERTBOT_STAGING=true`, so you don't hit any service limits at Let's Encrypt.
    - By default, this template will use Let's Encrypt for certificate generation. If you are just testing, you may use Let's Encrypt testing endpoint `https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory` to avoid being rate limited.
    - For your production applications, we strongly recommend **NOT** using Let's Encrypt certificates. Contact your ministry/department to determine best practices for production SSL/TLS certificate management.

    ``` sh
    export CERTBOT_SERVER=<YOURCERTBOTSERVER>
    export EMAIL=<some-valid@email.com>

    oc process -n $NAMESPACE -f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BCDevOps/certbot/master/openshift/certbot.dc.yaml" -p EMAIL=$EMAIL -p NAMESPACE=$NAMESPACE -p CERTBOT_SERVER=$CERTBOT_SERVER | oc apply -n $NAMESPACE -f -
    ```

    _PS: You MUST supply a valid email address!_

To include this cronjob in your pipeline, it is recommended that you copy `certbot.bc.yaml` and `certbot.dc.yaml` to your appliciton project. The build config will point back to this repo to include the latest changes to the contents of the docker folder. _Note: If you are using BCDK, there is a bug in it that requires you to have a "docker" folder in your repo._

## Manual Run

If you need to run the CronJob manually, you can do that by running:

``` sh
# Delete any previous manual Jobs created
# Note: When there are no jobs to delete, you will get an error for oc delete.
oc get job -n $NAMESPACE -o name | grep -F -e '-manual-' | xargs oc delete -n $NAMESPACE

# Create a Job
oc create job -n $NAMESPACE "certbot-manual-$(date +%s)" --from=cronjob/certbot
```

## Cleanup

To remove certbot from your namespace, run the following commands. All build related manifests will have a `build=certbot` label, and all cronjob application related manifests will have an `app=certbot` label.

``` sh
export NAMESPACE=<YOURNAMESPACE>

# Delete all manifests generated by certbot.dc.yaml
oc delete all,cronjob,nsp,pvc,rolebinding,sa -n $NAMESPACE --selector app=certbot

# Delete all manifests generated by certbot.dc.yaml
oc delete all -n $NAMESPACE --selector build=certbot
```

## Tips

1. If you are going to setup automatic cert renewals for the first time, backup "Certficate", "Private Key" and "CA Certificate" contents from your route.
1. List your cron jobs

    ``` sh
    export NAMESPACE=<YOURNAMESPACE>

    oc get -n $NAMESPACE cronjob
    ```

1. To describe your cron job

    ``` sh
    export NAMESPACE=<YOURNAMESPACE>

    oc describe -n $NAMESPACE cronjob/certbot
    ```

1. To see your cron jobs in Openshift GUI: Resources > Other Resources > Job
1. To access the logs for cron jobs in Openshift GUI: Monitoring > Uncheck "Hide older resources". You will see recently terminated certbot that would have terminated based on your schedule.
1. If you are seeing errors in the logs and need to troubleshoot, you can use optional parameters DEBUG and DELETE_ACME_ROUTES.

    ``` sh
    export CERTBOT_SERVER=<YOURCERTBOTSERVER>
    export EMAIL=<some-valid@email.com>
    export NAMESPACE=<YOURNAMESPACE>

    oc process -n $NAMESPACE -f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BCDevOps/certbot/master/openshift/certbot.dc.yaml" -p EMAIL=$EMAIL -p NAMESPACE=$NAMESPACE -p CERTBOT_SERVER=$CERTBOT_SERVER -p CERTBOT_STAGING=false -p DEBUG=true -p DELETE_ACME_ROUTES=false | oc apply -n $NAMESPACE -f -
    ```

    _PS: Ensure that you manually delete the ACME Route and Service after you are done troubleshooting and redeploy without the DEBUG and DELETE_ACME_ROUTES options!_

1. If you end up running the setup process multiple times, ensure that you have deleted all the duplicate copies of those cron jobs and only keep the latest one. Or to delete all the certbot jobs and start fresh you can use the below.

    ``` sh
    export NAMESPACE=<YOURNAMESPACE>

    oc get job -n $NAMESPACE -o name | grep -F -e 'certbot' | xargs oc delete
    oc get cronjob -n $NAMESPACE -o name | grep -F -e 'certbot' | xargs oc delete
    ```

1. To suspend a cronjob in your namespace, you can use the below patch command.

    ``` sh
    export NAMESPACE=<YOURNAMESPACE>

    oc patch cronjob -n $NAMESPACE certbot -p '{"spec" : {"suspend" : false }}'
    ```

1. To resume a cronjob in your namespace, you can use the below patch command.

    ``` sh
    export NAMESPACE=<YOURNAMESPACE>
    
    oc patch cronjob -n $NAMESPACE certbot -p '{"spec" : {"suspend" : true }}'
    ```
