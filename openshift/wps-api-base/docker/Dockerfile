# For the final stage, we use ubuntu:24.04
# Rationale for using ubuntu:24.04:
# - It's the latest ubuntu LTS release.
# - It generally has a more recent version of gdal than debian.
# - It generally has a fairly recent version of python.
# - It has a more recent version of wkhtmltopdf and supporting libraries than debian.
#
# When building local, you can pull direct from docker, instead of artifacts.developer.gov.bc.ca:
# docker build --build-arg DOCKER_IMAGE=ubuntu:24.04 . --tag=wps-api-base:ubuntu.24.04-latest
