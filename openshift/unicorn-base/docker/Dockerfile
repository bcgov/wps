# Install old (2.4.*; current debian) version of gdal
RUN apt-get -y update
RUN apt-get -y install libgdal-dev

# wildfire one may have an old certificate, so we have to make debian more forgiving.

# Update pip  
RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# According to the stackexchange thread below, we need to install numpy before
# installing gdal or we could end up missing _gdal_array

RUN python -m pip install numpy

# Install gdal
# We don't have much control over what version of gdal we're getting, it's pretty much whatever is
# available to us. As such, gdal is not installed by poetry, since the version will differ between
# platforms.
RUN python -m pip install gdal==$(gdal-config --version)
